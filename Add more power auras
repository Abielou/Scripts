local frame = CreateFrame("FRAME")

        local unitid = ... if unitid ~= "player" then return end

        if UnitBuff("player", "Eradication") then
                SpellActivationOverlay_ShowOverlay(SpellActivationOverlayFrame, 64371, "TEXTURES\\SPELLACTIVATIONOVERLAYS\\GENERICTOP_01.BLP", "TOP", 1.2, 139, 65, 239, false, false)
        else
                SpellActivationOverlay_HideOverlays(SpellActivationOverlayFrame, 64371)
        end


// First, change "Eradication" to whatever you need. (Use the locale/language you actually play on.)

Next, here's how you configure this whole thing:
SpellActivationOverlay_ShowOverlay(self, spellID, texturePath, location, scale, r, g, b, info.vFlip, info.hFlip)
It's all pretty self-explanatory. Keep the first argument as it is in the script above, everything else you can change/edit as you wish to. The last two arguments are vertical and horizontal flips, "r, g, b" are red/green/blue color codes (0-255).

To get the spellID, find your spell/aura on wowhead and look at the address bar. The number is the spellID. Keep in mind you need the spellID of the buff, not the spell that triggers it - they are sometimes different.

// Just change the last part of the texture path provided in the example above to any of these.

If that's not enough, you can always steal a file from Power Auras or other addons. To specify an external texture: "Interface\\AddOns\\YourAddon\\yourtexture.tga" - you can use .tga files; in general, you can use any texture/picture available to the game (anything in the game files and anything in addon folders). //
